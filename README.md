# OOP Workshop - Cosmetics Shop 2

## Preface

Before you start coding, read this document from top to bottom. It has some valuable information that will make your work easier.

## Description

You are given a software system for managing a cosmetics shop. There are several models - two types of products (`Shampoo` and `Toothpaste`), as well as a `Category` and a `Shopping cart`. Your task is to design an object-oriented class hierarchy to model the cosmetics shop, using the best practices for object-oriented design (OOD) and object-oriented programming (OOP). Encapsulate all fields correctly and use validation whenever needed.

## Architecture

The system already has a working `Engine` which executes a sequence of commands read from the console. It uses the classes and interfaces in your project (see the `CosmeticsEngine` class). You do not have to touch anything in it or the `main()` method, but you could try to understand how they work. 

## Models

> Note: All validation intervals are inclusive (closed).

### **ShampooImpl**

- Implements `Shampoo`.
- Each `shampoo` in the system has a `name, brand, price, gender, milliliters, and usage type`.
- `name` - the name's length should be between `3` and `10` symbols.
- Exception message: `Name should be between 3 and 10 symbols.`
- `brand` - the brand name's length should be between `2` and `10` symbols.
- Exception message: `Brand should be between 2 and 10 symbols.`
- `price` - the price cannot be negative.
- Exception message: `Price should be non negative.`
- `Gender type` can be one of `[Men, Women or Unisex]`.
- `milliliters` cannot be negative.
- Exception message: `Milliliters should be non negative.`
- `Usage type` can be `[Every_Day or Medical]`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
#{name} {brand}
 #Price: {price}
 #Gender: {genderType}
 #Milliliters: {milliliters}
 #Usage: {usageType}
 ===
```

### **ToothpasteImpl**

- Implements `Toothpaste`.
- Each `toothpaste` in the system has `name, brand, price, gender, and ingredients`.
- `name` - the name's length should be between `3` and `10` symbols.
- Exception message: `Name should be between 3 and 10 symbols.`
- `brand` - the brand name's length should be between `2` and `10` symbols.
- Exception message: `Brand should be between 2 and 10 symbols.`
- `price` - cannot be negative.
- Exception message: `Price should be non negative.`
- `Gender type` can be `[Men, Women or Unisex]`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
#{name} {brand}
 #Price: {price}
 #Gender: {genderType}
 #Ingredients: [VALUE, VALUE]
 ===
```

### **CategoryImpl**
- Has a `name` and a `list of products`.
- `name` - the name's length should be between `2` and `15` symbols.
- Exception message: `Name should be between 2 and 15 symbols.`
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
#Category: Shampoos
#{name} {brand}
 #Price: {price}
 #Gender: {genderType}
 #Milliliters: {milliliters}
 #Usage: {usageType}
 ===
#{name} {brand}
 #Price: {price}
 #Gender: {genderType}
 #Milliliters: {milliliters}
 #Usage: {usageType}
 ===
#{name} {brand}
 #Price: {price}
 #Gender: {genderType}
 #Milliliters: {milliliters}
 #Usage: {usageType}
 ===
```

```none
#Category: Shampoos
 #No product in this category
```

### **ShoppingCartImpl**

- Has a `list of products`.

## CosmeticsRepositoryImpl

The `CosmeticsRepositoryImpl` class stores all the application's data. It also handles creating new objects and is used to find existing ones. Your task is implementing all methods that throw `UnsupportedOperationException()`. 

## Interfaces

- All the needed interfaces are already there. **You must use them all** to achieve the best OOP design.
- When doing the advanced task you need to **create** and use interfaces.

## Constraints

- Have a look at the example below to get a better understanding of the printing format.
- Format all floating-point values with **two digits** after the decimal point.
- All methods in the above interfaces are **mandatory** (cannot return null or empty).

## Additional notes

- Put your classes in **cosmetics.models** package.
- If you decide to create and use new classes and/or interfaces, you can do so.
- When you implement an unfinished method (one that throws `UnsupportedOperationException()`), delete the `throws new...` line.

## Unit Tests

- You are given unit tests to keep track of your progress.
- Run them by right-clicking the **tests** package and selecting **Run 'All Tests'**.
- If you get stuck, check out the tests' names to guide you on what to do.

> *Hint*: Run the unit tests whenever you finish a task.
> Note: Be careful not to change anything in the **tests** folder.

## Step-by-step guide

> *Note*: The project won't compile initially. First, you need to build to correct interface hierarchy.
> *Important*: See the methods in `ParsingHelpers` and `ValidationHelpers` classes and use them whenever possible!

1. Implement the classes for `Shampoo` and `Toothpaste`.

   - Implement the necessary interfaces.
   - Look at the **models.contracts** package and think about how to build a correct hierarchy.
   - Create the necessary fields and initialize them in the constructor.
   - Validate all the fields according to the constraints above.
   - Implement all necessary methods. Leave the `print()` method for later.
   - Did you notice the repeating code in the `ShampooImpl` and `ToothpasteImpl` classes (the common fields/methods)? What could you do to avoid the repetition?

2. Implement the unfinished methods in `CosmeticsRepositoryImpl`.

   - This is where the creation of the object should be.
   - Add the newly created object to the list.

3. Implement `CreateShampooCommand` and `CreateToothpasteCommand`.

   - In the `execute()` method, validate that the input parameters' count matches the expected count. Next, they should be extracted and parsed, then used to create the `Shampoo`/`Toothpaste`.

    > *Hint*: Look at `CreateCategoryCommand` if you get stuck.

4. Implement methods in `CommandFactoryImpl`.

   - This is where we connect the incoming command from the console with the class that implements that command.

5. Implement the `print()` methods.

**6. ADVANCED TASK**

- Implement the new product `Cream` and its creation in the `Engine` class.
	- Each `cream` in the system has a `name, brand, price, gender, and scent`.
	- `name` - the name's length should be between `3` and `15` symbols.
	- Exception message: `Name should be between 3 and 15 symbols.`
	- `brand` - the brand name's length should be between `3` and `15` symbols.
	- Exception message: `Brand should be between 3 and 15 symbols.`
	- `price` - is greater than zero.
	- Exception message: `Price should be non negative.`
	- `Gender type` can be `[Men, Women or Unisex]`.
	- `Scent type` can be `[Rose, Lavender or Vanilla]`.
	- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

	```none
	#{name} {brand}
	 #Price: {price}
	 #Gender: {genderType}
	 #Scent: {scentType}
	 ===
	```
- Implement product creation in the `Factory` and the `Repository`.
  - Just look at the other products.
- Test it if it works correctly.
